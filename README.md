## About

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with over a year of professional experience building production-grade AI systems that solve real business problems. My work focuses on computer vision, document intelligence, and natural language processing â€” transforming unstructured data into actionable insights.

I design and deploy end-to-end ML pipelines that reduce manual workload, improve operational efficiency, and scale with business needs. From training custom deep learning models to serving them through robust APIs, I handle the complete lifecycle of ML systems in production environments.

My approach centers on practical implementation: understanding the problem deeply, architecting scalable solutions, and measuring real-world impact.

## Professional Experience

**Deep Learning Model Development**  
Trained/Fine-tuned neural networks for various computer vision tasks including detection, recognition, and classification. Leveraged convolutional and transformer-based architectures to achieve consistent performance across diverse datasets and deployment scenarios.

**Document Intelligence Systems**  
Built systems that understand document structure and extract meaningful information from unstructured sources. Implemented solutions combining optical character recognition, layout analysis, and language models to automate information extraction workflows at scale.

**Production ML Infrastructure**  
Developed automated data pipelines for collection, preprocessing, and annotation that significantly reduced manual effort. Created modular, maintainable codebases for training, inference, and evaluation. Deployed models through API endpoints integrated with broader production systems.

**Computer Vision Applications**  
Implemented real-time vision systems for operational use cases including object detection, tracking, and counting. Built recognition systems using embedding-based approaches and efficient similarity search mechanisms for fast matching across large datasets.

**Natural Language Processing**  
Developed retrieval-augmented generation systems enabling semantic search and question-answering over document collections. Implemented chunking strategies, vector-based retrieval, and integration with language models for context-aware responses.

**Data Matching and Entity Resolution**  
Built intelligent matching systems for reconciling entities across disparate datasets. Designed pipelines that transform structured records into embeddings, leverage vector similarity search to identify candidate matches, and employ language models for final disambiguation. Implemented workflows that process master datasets and transaction records, returning ranked matches with high precision for downstream automation.
